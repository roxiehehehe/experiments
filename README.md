This repo contains my random experiments code to simulate things. 

Environment Setup
-----
In order to run notebooks in this repo effortlessly, you need to install the following

* Python3 and `virtualenv`.Then you can install all the packages in the `requirement.txt`. 
* Specifically for running notebooks:
  * For the "100people" notebook: `brew install ffmpeg && brew install yasm` for the animation to show
  * I also install the `ipython widget` using `conda`. `conda install -c conda-forge ipywidgets`
